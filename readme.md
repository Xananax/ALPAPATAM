# ALPAPAAM

A project to create an "As Low-Poly As Possible Anatomically Accurate 3D Model". Thus the name. Yeah. I'm bad at names.

![current progress](current_progress.jpg)

## Rationale

There are many medically-accurate 3D models out there; this is not one. Medically accurate 3D models are full of noise and intersecting polys, and not suitable for proper visualization, simulation, or learning.

This model emphasises on:

- Minimum viable detail for artists: If a muscle isn't really relevant for drawing, then it isn't there
- Still thrive to contain all the internal organs necessary, so this can be used as a learning or teaching tool 
- Very low-poly resolution: this should run without troubles even on the lowest-end PC
- Open-source: everyone is invited to contribute
- Permissive License: feel free to use this model for anything, no attribution necessary (though sending me a note so I can see what you've done with it is welcome)
- Potentially provide a way to export the modified model for further customization, ala [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org/) or [ManuelBastioniLab](http://www.manuelbastioni.com/manuellab.php).

## Planned features

A check denotes that the feature has been implemented.

- [x] Model A skeleton
- [x] Model muscles
- [x] Model subcutaneous fat
- [x] Model visceral fat
- [x] Model external skin with the best possible edge loops while staying as low poly as possible
- [x] Model main internal organ and genitals
- [ ] Rig Bones to rotate accurately
- [ ] Rig Muscles to follow bones movement
- [ ] Rig Muscles to deform accurately according to bones movement
- [ ] Rig IK with optional FK
- [ ] Control helpers for fingers, toes, and foot
- [ ] Provide sliders for muscles definition
- [ ] Provide sliders for fat deposits (belly, etc)
- [ ] Provide sliders for gender
- [ ] Provide deformation sliders to get a toony aspect
- [ ] Have the skin follow all deformations
- [ ] Provide the way to "bake" the skin with deformations into a sculptable character, conserving the rig
- [ ] Export an interactive app, through BGE or another game engine
